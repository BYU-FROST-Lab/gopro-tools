## What each script does

**`organize_missions.py`** — Scans a folder of GoPro camera subfolders, groups recordings across cameras into "missions" by matching start times and durations, produces a reviewable CSV, and moves files into named output folders after human approval.

**`compact_missions.py`** — Scans a folder of already-organized mission subfolders (identified by `.gopro_mission` marker), concatenates chapter files per camera into single videos using lossless stream copy, and moves all originals to a `raw/` subfolder.

**`utils.py`** — Shared code imported by both scripts: `MISSION_MARKER`, `NAME_RE`, `VIDEO_EXTS`, `PROXY_EXTS`, `THUMB_EXTS`, `FileEntry`, `Recording`, `ffprobe()`, `thm_creation()`, `mtime()`, `best_start()`, `total_duration()`. Any future tool in this repo should import from here rather than re-implementing.

**`extract_telemetry.py`** — Reads GPMF binary streams from raw chapter MP4 files (from `raw/` subfolders or main folder if not compacted), extracts telemetry data, and writes results into `{mission}/data/`. Does not modify any video files.

**`sync_gyro.py`** — Estimates temporal offsets between cameras (and any other IMU source in `data/`) by cross-correlating gyroscope magnitude `|ω|`. Writes `gyro_offsets_s` into `metadata.json`. Any `*_gyro.csv` placed in `{mission}/data/` is automatically included — including `bluerov2_gyro.csv` produced by `extract_ros_imu.py`.

**`crop_missions.py`** — Crops every camera in a mission to a time window given on the *reference* camera's timeline, keeping all cameras synchronized via their measured clock offsets. Cropped output is named `{camera}.MP4` (and `{camera}_LRV.MP4` with `--lrv`); the pre-crop original is moved into `raw/`. Dry-run by default. Imports `ffprobe` from `utils.py`.

**`overlay_stats.py`** — Reads any topic/field from a ROS bag and generates an ASS subtitle file that overlays the values on a GoPro video. No re-encoding — load the `.ass` file alongside the video in VLC, mpv, or DaVinci Resolve. Requires `pyyaml` (`pip install pyyaml`).

**`extract_ros_imu.py`** — Reads a ROS bag file (ROS1 `.bag` or ROS2 `.db3`/`.mcap`) and extracts `angular_velocity` and `linear_acceleration` from a `sensor_msgs/msg/Imu` topic. Writes `{name}_gyro.csv` and `{name}_accl.csv` in the same format as `extract_telemetry.py`, so `sync_gyro.py` can consume them directly. Requires the `rosbags` library (`pip install rosbags`).

## organize_missions.py architecture

```
discover()
  → list[Recording], list[orphan]

cluster_missions(recordings)          ← auto mode
import_missions_csv(file, recordings) ← --import mode
  → list[list[Recording]], list[names]

build_plan(root, missions, orphans, names, leftovers)
  → list[(src_path, dst_path)]

print_matrix / print_timeline / print_plan   ← reporting only
export_plan_csv                              ← writes annotated CSV
execute(plan)                                ← only with --execute
```

## compact_missions.py architecture

```
find_missions(root)
  → list[mission_folder_path]       ← finds subfolders with .gopro_mission marker

parse_mission_files(folder)
  → dict[(camera, ext) -> [(chapter_int, path), ...]]

ffmpeg_concat(chapter_paths, output_path, dry_run, output_fmt=None)
  → bool                            ← stream copy via concat demuxer; -copy_unknown preserves GPMF

compact_mission(folder, lrv, dry_run, force)
  → bool
```

**compact_missions.py file-handling rules:**

| File type | Without `--lrv` | With `--lrv` |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------|
| MP4, multi-chapter | concat → `{camera}.MP4`, originals → `raw/` | same |
| MP4, single-chapter | leave GX filename as-is | same |
| LRV, multi-chapter | → `raw/` | concat → `{camera}_LRV.MP4`, originals → `raw/` |
| LRV, single-chapter | → `raw/` | rename in-place `GL…_LRV.MP4`, stay in folder |
| THM, any | → `raw/` | → `raw/` |

**COMPACT_RE** — separate regex for organized files (post-`organize_missions.py`):
`^(?P<prefix>G[XLH])(?P<chapter>\d{2})(?P<video>\d{4})_(?P<camera>[^.]+)\.(?P<ext>[A-Za-z0-9]+)$`
This is distinct from `NAME_RE` in `utils.py` which matches pre-organization filenames.

## Key data structures

**`FileEntry`** — one file on disk (MP4, LRV, or THM). Fields: `path`, `camera`, `prefix`, `chapter`, `video` (4-char string), `ext`.

**`Recording`** — all chapters of one video# from one camera. Fields: `camera`, `video`, `files: list[FileEntry]`, `start` (epoch float), `start_src` (how start was obtained), `duration` (float seconds), `dur_src`.

**`missions`** — `list[list[Recording]]`. Each inner list is one mission; order within the inner list doesn't matter. A Recording appears in at most one mission.

**`mission_names`** — parallel `list[str]` of folder name suffixes. `None` when auto-clustering (names are computed from index). Index `i` of `names` corresponds to index `i` of `missions`.

## Important invariants

- **Video# is a 4-char string** (`"0147"`, not `147`). This preserves leading zeros. Never convert to int inside the script.
- **One recording per camera per mission.** `cluster_missions` enforces this; `import_missions_csv` does not check — if the user duplicates a camera in the CSV, the second is skipped with a warning.
- **Anchor-based clustering, not chaining.** Each mission is anchored to its first (earliest) recording. Later recordings must be within tolerance of the *anchor*, not of each other. This prevents drift across a long chain of near-misses. Do not change this to pairwise/chaining without understanding the implications.
- **Moves only, no copies.** `build_plan` produces `(src, dst)` pairs; `execute` calls `shutil.move`. Never use `shutil.copy`.
- **Output folders are marked.** `execute` writes a zero-byte `.gopro_mission` file into every folder it creates. `discover` checks for this marker to skip those folders on re-runs. This replaces the old `MISSION_PREFIX` prefix-check approach, which broke when the prefix was empty.

## Metadata fallback chain

For each recording's start time: `ffprobe creation_time` → THM file EXIF → filesystem mtime.
For duration: sum of `ffprobe duration` across chapters → mtime span between chapters (approximate).

`start_src` and `dur_src` fields record which source was used. The `--timeline` flag surfaces these. The `!W` warning flag (weak metadata) exists in `mission_warnings()` but is not currently emitted in the CSV export (removed when `_src` columns were dropped). Re-add to `export_plan_csv` if needed.

## CSV import/export contract

**Export** writes diagnostic columns that are ignored on import. **Import** finds camera columns by exact header name match against discovered cameras — position-independent. This means extra columns can be added to the CSV without breaking import.

The video# cell for each camera is the only cell that drives file moves. All other columns (`start`, `dur`, warning flags, `_Δt`) are informational.

Preamble rows (lines starting with `#`) and blank rows are skipped on import.

Video numbers are matched as-is first, then zero-padded to 4 digits as fallback (handles spreadsheet apps that strip leading zeros).

## Adding a new warning flag

1. Add detection logic in `mission_warnings(group) -> list[str]`
2. Add a column header in the `header` list in `export_plan_csv`
3. Add the corresponding `"X" if "!FLAG" in flags else ""` cell in the row-building loop
4. `import_missions_csv` needs no changes (it ignores non-camera columns)

## Adding support for a new file type

1. Add the extension to `VIDEO_EXTS`, `PROXY_EXTS`, or `THUMB_EXTS` as appropriate
2. `suffixed_name` handles all extensions uniformly — no changes needed there
3. If it's a new "primary" type (like MP4 is now), update the `has_mp4` check in `discover` and the `best_start` / `total_duration` functions

## Common extension points

**Custom mission prefix:** Set `MISSION_PREFIX = "mission_"` to get `mission_DiveArea` folders. Currently defaults to `""`.

**Tighter/looser matching:** Adjust `START_TOL_S` and `DUR_TOL_S` at top of file or via `--start-tol` / `--dur-tol` CLI args.

**Same-video time-gap split:** If a camera reuses a 4-digit video# after a card reformat, two separate sessions collapse into one Recording. The `--timeline` output makes this visible (one recording with chapters hours apart). To fix: add a split in `discover` that starts a new Recording when consecutive chapters have an mtime gap larger than some threshold.

**Multiple recordings per camera per mission:** Not currently supported. The clustering algorithm enforces one-per-camera. If this is ever needed, the `build_plan` destination naming would need to de-conflict files.

## Things not to change without care

- `NAME_RE` pattern — must match GoPro filename convention exactly
- The `id(r)` trick in `main()` for computing leftovers — works because Recording objects are unique Python objects; don't replace with value-based equality
- `execute` pre-flight checks — the abort-on-collision logic prevents data loss; don't weaken it

## extract_telemetry.py architecture

```
find_missions(root)
  → list[mission_folder_path]       ← finds subfolders with .gopro_mission marker

find_gpmf_sources(mission)
  → dict[camera -> list[Path]]      ← raw/ GX MP4s preferred; falls back to main folder
                                       GL (LRV proxy) files and *_LRV named files excluded

extract_gpmf_binary(mp4)
  → bytes | None                    ← ffmpeg stream copy of gpmd stream to stdout

parse_gpmf_packets(raw_bytes)
  → list[packet_dict]               ← one dict per DEVC block; contains stream data with STMP/SCAL

extract_timeseries(packets, stream_key)
  → (timestamps_s, scaled_rows)     ← STMP-based timing; values divided by SCAL

process_mission(mission, ...)
  → writes data/ subfolder          ← CSVs, GPX (if GPS5 present), PNG plots, metadata.json
```

**Output layout per mission:**
```
{mission}/
  data/
    metadata.json              ← per-camera sizes, durations, creation times, sync offsets
    {camera}_accl.csv          ← t_s, ax_ms2, ay_ms2, az_ms2
    {camera}_gyro.csv          ← t_s, gx_rads, gy_rads, gz_rads
    {camera}_grav.csv          ← t_s, gx, gy, gz (normalized gravity vector)
    {camera}_cori.csv          ← t_s, w, x, y, z (camera orientation quaternion / 32767)
    {camera}_iori.csv          ← t_s, w, x, y, z (image orientation quaternion / 32767)
    {camera}_gps.csv           ← t_s, lat_deg, lon_deg, alt_m, speed_ms, accuracy_m [if GPS5]
    {camera}.gpx               ← GPS track [if GPS5 present]
    plots/
      all_cameras_accel_magnitude.png  ← overlay for event detection / sync validation
      {camera}_accl.png
      {camera}_gyro.png
      {camera}_grav.png
      gps_all_cameras.png      ← track + altitude [if GPS5 present]
      summary.png              ← text card: sizes, durations, streams, sync offsets
```

**GPMF file discovery rules:**
- Scans both `raw/` and main mission folder; `raw/` GX chapters take priority per camera.
- Skips all GL-prefix files (LRV proxies) in both locations.
- Skips `*_LRV.MP4`-named compacted proxies (matched by SIMPLE_RE but filtered by `_LRV` suffix).
- Compacted `{camera}.MP4` files in main folder are used only when no `raw/` chapters exist for that camera; these files often lack GPMF if `compact_missions.py` didn't use `-copy_unknown`.

**GPMF timing model:**
- Each DEVC block carries a STMP (microseconds since recording start) per stream — the timestamp of the last sample in that block.
- Multi-chapter recordings: chapter offsets added so timestamps are continuous across chapters.
- Within a block, N samples are spaced evenly from the previous block's STMP to the current STMP.

**GPMF streams on HERO11 Black (these cameras):**
- No GPS5 stream — GPS appears to be disabled. GPS columns will be absent from CSVs.
- ACCL at ~200 Hz (m/s², scaled by SCAL ≈ 417)
- GYRO at ~200 Hz (rad/s, scaled by SCAL ≈ 939)
- GRAV at ~24 Hz (normalized gravity direction)
- CORI / IORI at ~24 Hz (orientation quaternions, /32767 → [-1, 1])

## GoPro telemetry (GPMF) and ffmpeg

GoPro MP4 files contain a third stream alongside video and audio: **GPMF** (GoPro Metadata Format), a binary data track carrying GPS, gyroscope, accelerometer, and temperature at high sample rates. Key facts:

- `ffmpeg -c copy` (stream copy) is supposed to preserve GPMF, but **in practice the compacted `{camera}.MP4` files produced by `compact_missions.py` are missing the gpmd stream** (confirmed on DiveArea: compacted `Front.MP4` has only 3 streams; raw `GX010147_Front.MP4` has 4 including gpmd). The originals in `raw/` always have GPMF intact — `extract_telemetry.py` reads from `raw/` specifically because of this.
- The warning `Could not find codec parameters for stream 2 (Unknown: none)` is expected. ffmpeg can't identify the GPMF codec but copies the raw bytes anyway. Adding `-copy_unknown` makes this explicit and ensures the stream is always included.
- Re-encoding video (`-c:v libx265` etc.) will silently drop GPMF unless you add `-map 0 -c:d copy`.
- `.LRV` files are standard MP4 containers with a renamed extension. ffmpeg cannot auto-detect the output format from the `.LRV` extension — pass `-f mp4` explicitly, or output to a `.MP4` filename (current approach: `{camera}_LRV.MP4`).
- **Do not install `gopro2gpx` or `gpmf-parser` as dependencies.** `extract_telemetry.py` contains a native GPMF binary parser that handles all streams (GPS5, ACCL, GYRO, GRAV, CORI, IORI) without external packages. `exiftool -GPS*` only returns the starting-point coordinates, not the full track.

## crop_missions.py architecture

```
find_missions(root)
  → [mission, ...]                ← root itself if marked, else marked subfolders

load_metadata(mission)            → dict | None  (None = skip mission)
resolve_offsets(meta)
  → (ref_camera, {cam: (offset_s, "gyro"|"sync"|"missing")})
                                    per camera: gyro_offsets_s preferred, sync_offsets_s fallback

find_main_video(mission, cam)     → {cam}.MP4 or GX*_{cam}.MP4
find_lrv_video(mission, cam)      → {cam}_LRV.MP4 / GL*_{cam}_LRV.MP4 / GL*_{cam}.LRV

_window_for(start_ref, end_ref, offset, src_dur)
  → (start, dur, warnings)        ← applies offset, clamps to footage bounds

ffmpeg_crop(src, dst, start, dur, dry_run, reencode)
  → bool                          ← -ss before -i; stream copy (+copy_unknown) or -c:v libx265

crop_mission(...)                 → dry-run prints plan; execute crops + archives
```

**Offset/timing model:** `offset[C]` = seconds camera C started AFTER the reference (same convention as `sync_gyro.py`). For a window `[start_ref, end_ref]` on the reference timeline, camera C is cropped at `start_ref - offset[C]` for the same real-world moments. Negative offset (C started before ref) → C is cropped *later*. The reference camera is the one with offset 0.0.

**Offset source priority (per the user's requirement):** `gyro_offsets_s` first (sub-frame accurate, from gyro cross-correlation), then `sync_offsets_s` (creation-time, second-resolution). A camera with neither is skipped.

**Clamping:** If `start_C < 0` the clip is clamped to footage start (aligns at END, warns). If `end_C > camera_duration` it clamps to footage end (aligns at START, warns). Duration is recomputed after clamping.

**Crop method:** Default is stream copy (`-c copy -copy_unknown`) — fast, preserves GPMF telemetry, but the cut lands on the nearest keyframe at/before the start (sub-second imprecision per camera). `--reencode` re-encodes video with libx265 for frame-accurate cuts while copying audio + data streams. `-ss` is placed before `-i` for fast input seeking in both modes.

**Archival flow (execute):** Crops to `{name}.cropping` temp → `shutil.move` original into `raw/` → `os.replace` temp into final name. This ensures the original is preserved before the final name is taken. Pre-flight aborts the mission if a pre-crop original already exists in `raw/` (unless `--force`). Writes `.gopro_mission` into `raw/` if absent.

**Re-running:** Because cropped output reuses `{camera}.MP4`, re-running crop on an already-cropped mission would crop the cropped file. The raw/ collision check is the guard — the original is already in raw/, so a second run trips the pre-flight unless `--force`.

## overlay_stats.py architecture

```
load_config(config_path, mission_dir)
  → validated cfg dict with "bag_path" resolved

build_specs(cfg)
  → list[OverlaySpec]           ← one per overlay entry in YAML

resolve_positions(specs, W, H, line_height)
  → mutates specs in-place      ← assigns x, y, an (ASS numpad alignment)

load_bag_topics(bag_path, {topic: [field, ...]})
  → {topic: {"t_s": ndarray, field: ndarray, ...}}
    timestamps normalized to start at 0 (header.stamp preferred)

generate_ass(out_path, specs, topic_data, fps, ...)
  → writes .ass file            ← run-length encodes identical consecutive values
```

**Config file format** (`overlays.yaml` in each mission folder):

```yaml
bag: plane_2.0-2026-06-11-12-59-10   # relative to mission dir or absolute
bag_offset_s: 150.045                 # seconds bag started AFTER GoPro t=0
camera: Front                         # drives video probe for PlayRes
font_size: 40                         # use 40+ for 5K video, 16-20 for LRV
line_height: 50

overlays:
  - topic: /bluerov2/imu/data
    field: angular_velocity.x         # dot-notation; supports field[0] array indexing
    label: "Gyro X"
    unit: "rad/s"
    format: ".3f"
    position: top-left                # or top-right/bottom-left/bottom-right/top-center/bottom-center
    color: "#00FF00"
    enabled: true                     # optional, default true
```

**Positions:** Named anchors (`top-left`, `top-right`, `bottom-left`, `bottom-right`, `top-center`, `bottom-center`) or `[x, y]` pixel list. Multiple overlays at the same anchor stack vertically. ASS `\an` numpad alignment is set automatically so right-anchored text right-justifies without needing to estimate text width.

**ASS color format:** `&H00BBGGRR&` — R and B are swapped from HTML `#RRGGBB`. Alpha 0x00 = opaque (first byte). The script converts automatically via `_html_to_ass()`.

**Timing:** `t_lookup = t_video - bag_offset_s`. If `t_lookup < 0` (bag hasn't started yet) or `> bag_duration`, the overlay shows "N/A". Uses `np.interp` for interpolation between bag samples.

**Run-length encoding:** Consecutive frames with the same formatted value extend the previous Dialogue event rather than creating a new one. For slow-changing fields this drastically reduces file size (the Plane mission N/A period generates just 5 events instead of ~3600).

**Subclip support (`--start` / `--end`):** All Dialogue timestamps are shifted by `-start_s` so the ASS file aligns with a video that has been trimmed to `[start_s, end_s]`.

**PlayRes:** Probed from the actual video at runtime. Set `font_size` accordingly — 40pt at 5K (5312×2988) is visually equivalent to ~6pt at 540p (LRV). To target the LRV proxy, change `camera` to `Front_LRV` or similar and adjust `font_size`.

## extract_ros_imu.py architecture

```
extract_imu(bag_path, topic, out_dir)
  → writes {name}_gyro.csv and {name}_accl.csv

Uses rosbags.highlevel.AnyReader — auto-detects format from path:
  - ROS1 .bag file  → pass the .bag file path
  - ROS2 multi-file bag (directory of .mcap + metadata.yaml) → pass the directory path
```

**ROS timestamp vs IMU header stamp — always use the header stamp:**

The `rosbags` iterator yields `(connection, timestamp_ns, rawdata)`. The `timestamp_ns` is the **bag record time** — when the OS received and logged the message. On the Plane dataset this lagged the sensor by 4–25 ms with ~3.5 ms stdev (OS scheduling jitter). It is not suitable for precision sync.

Always use `msg.header.stamp` instead:
```python
stamp = msg.header.stamp
t_s = stamp.sec + stamp.nanosec * 1e-9
```

**Units — ROS matches GoPro, no conversion needed:**
- `angular_velocity` (gyro): rad/s — same as GoPro GYRO stream
- `linear_acceleration` (accel): m/s² — same as GoPro ACCL stream

**Apparent Hz display artifact in sync_gyro.py:**

`sync_gyro.py` reports Hz as `1 / median(diff(t))`. ROS IMU messages can be bursty (bursts with sub-millisecond gaps between messages in the same burst), making the median inter-sample gap smaller than the true period. The Plane bluerov2 shows ~349 Hz in the display but the actual average rate is 392 693 samples / 1964 s ≈ 200 Hz. The cross-correlation is unaffected because both signals are resampled to a uniform 5 ms grid before correlating.

**One bag per mission — invariant:**

Each mission folder contains exactly one ROS bag directory. `extract_ros_imu.py` discovers bags by scanning for `metadata.yaml` (ROS2) or `.bag` files (ROS1) and writes output into `{bag_parent}/data/`. This works correctly only when each mission has one bag; multiple bags per mission would overwrite each other's CSVs.

**Integrating a ROS bag with sync_gyro.py:**

1. Run `extract_ros_imu.py /path/to/root` to extract all missions at once — it writes CSVs directly into each mission's `data/` folder.
2. `sync_gyro.py` globs `*_gyro.csv` in `data/` — no changes needed; the new source is included automatically.
3. Set `--max-lag` large enough to cover the expected offset between the bag start and the GoPro reference camera start. On the Plane mission the bag started ~150 s after the GoPro Front camera, so `--max-lag 200` is the minimum safe value.
4. Pairwise consistency between the ROS source and each GoPro camera is printed automatically when ≥3 sources are present.

**Plane mission bag details (confirmed 2026-06-11):**
- Bag: `plane_2.0-2026-06-11-12-59-10/` (ROS2 multi-file mcap, 17 segments)
- IMU topic: `/bluerov2/imu/data` (`sensor_msgs/msg/Imu`, 200 Hz)
- Bag start epoch: 1781204353.465 s (header stamp); GoPro Front start: 1781204211.0 s
- Cross-correlation result: offset = +150 045 ms after Front, r = 0.8385

## Test data

`/media/bjm255/Frostlab/SandHollow` — already organized by `organize_missions.py` and compacted by `compact_missions.py`. Missions: Ball, BlueBoat, Dam, DiveArea, FlatOpen, Plane, other.

- Ball and other already have `data/` folders from `extract_telemetry.py` runs — use `--force` to re-extract.
- **other** and **Ball** are the best missions for quick testing (smallest files: other has clips under 32 MB; Ball has single-chapter GX files without the multi-chapter complexity of DiveArea/Dam).
- All cameras are HERO11 Black with GPS disabled — no GPS5 stream will appear in any file from this dataset.
- **Plane** has a ROS2 bag (`plane_2.0-2026-06-11-12-59-10/`) with a `/bluerov2/imu/data` topic. `bluerov2_gyro.csv` and `bluerov2_accl.csv` have already been extracted into `Plane/data/`. Use `--max-lag 200` when running `sync_gyro.py` on this mission.
